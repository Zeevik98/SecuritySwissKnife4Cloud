The Standard Output Format serves several critical purposes in our security operations automation:
Purpose & Usage

Standardized Incident Tracking


Used whenever any security lambda (containment or investigation) completes its operation
Ensures consistent data structure across different resource types (EC2, ECS, S3, etc.)
Enables automated correlation of related incidents


SIEM Integration


Provides a uniform format for ingestion into various SIEM platforms
Reduces the need for custom parsers for each event type
Makes it easier to create standardized dashboards and alerts


Incident Response Workflow


Tracks the complete lifecycle of an incident
Documents all actions taken
Maintains chain of custody for evidence


Compliance Requirements


Meets logging requirements for various frameworks (NIST, SOC2, GDPR)
Provides audit trail of security actions
Documents response timelines
